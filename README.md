# COMP90055 Research Project: Application of the Health Belief Model to Changes in Mobility Behaviour During COVID-19

This purpose of this repository is to store code used for the research project: "Application of the Health Belief Model to Changes in Mobility Behaviour During COVID-19". This research project was submitted to the University of Melbourne for the COMP90055 Research Project subject in Semester 1, 2024, as part of the Master of Information Technology. 

This repository contains two jupyter notebook files which were used for the research project:

- *Model_Selection_Outputs.ipynb*: This file contains a Python script for the first section of Methods/Results, "Model Selection". The script generates all possible candidate models, filters models based on an inequality (of probability of social distancing) defined by observed mobility trends, and prints out the models. 
- *Counterfactual_Heatmaps.ipyb*: This file contains a Python script for the second section of Methods/Results, "Counterfactual Scenarios". This script generates heat maps of probability of social distancing behaviour for the final four candidate models, in baseline, lockdown and support payments scenarios.
